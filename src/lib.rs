/* No code, as we know rust is a blazingly slow and bloated programming language that is memory unsafe (std::box::leak or sm shit)
and therefor should not be used to implement algorithms where time complexity matters


The C programming language is indeed memory safe and should be the preferred choice for situations like this
memory unsafety is a thing that happens when people are too dumb to let users access the x-th element of an array or cant afford a free() after malloc()
